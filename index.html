            Making a big leap and changing the platform wasn’t an easy task for React. The first version, made by Jordan Walke, was met with doubts and controversies inside Facebook as well. Many developers were often averse to change, insisting that it would not work. However, the team was not willing to let their hopes go up in smoke. They kept on modifying and optimizing the library, all the while retaining their faith in what the library could do in addressing concrete issues. The planning process of React was well-defined and well-understood by Jordan Walke and his team. They were able to contemplate the rationale of the component-based architectural approach in web development and how it could aid in improving the process. This belief in their vision encouraged them to remain focused on their goals despite facing obstacles and barriers. Another important step in the evolution of React was the ability to accumulate early support from other teams at Facebook. Some teams agreed to try it, and the favorable responses from these teams drove further adoption. These early examples helped attain wider acceptance of such transformations. Through feedback, the React team remained actively engaged in updating the library. They continued to refine it, add new features, and enhance performance, all of which contributed to the extensive acceptance of React. Keeping up with the trends and adapting to changes was crucial, but another essential factor that contributed to React’s success was its focus on community creation. By making it open-source, the team enabled developers globally to contribute, offer feedback, and nurture a massive range of libraries and tools in the React environment. This community support was instrumental in React’s development and usage statistics. Watching React.js: The Documentary made me realize that it is all about perseverance when the going gets tough, following one's dreams, and the strength of the community. Every time you encounter challenges while working on something, use React’s situation as a reference. Stand for your product, convince a few people of its superiority, and learn from the feedback. Who knows, your project may be the next big idea if acted upon.
